![Victor Freriks]({{ base.url }}/assets/victor.jpg)I design and code layouts using HTML(5), CSS(3), JavaScript and usually some kind of PHP framework or CMS combined with Git. However I spend quite some time each year coding themes for .NET projects on a TFS as well. Next to that I like to fiddle with static site generators.

Usually I work on my beefed up 2013 MacBook Pro 13" with an additional Thunderbolt screen using SublimeText3/Atom with a Gulp setup under the hood. But who cares, right?!

Currently I am employed at Divtag near ’s Hertogenbosch and take on freelance projects as well. I am quite busy though. If you’d like to get in touch I suggest hitting the back-button towards Google and contacting me through my LinkedIn profile. Thanks!
