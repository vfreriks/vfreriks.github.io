## Hi there, I’m Victor. ##

I design and code layouts using HTML(5), CSS(3), JavaScript and usually some kind of PHP framework or CMS combined with Git. However I spend quite some time each year coding themes for .NET projects on a TFS as well. I usually work on my beefed up MacBook Pro 13" with an additional Thunderbold screen using SublimeText3 and Grunt under the hood.

Currently I am employed at Divtag near ’s Hertogenbosch and take on freelance projects as well.

I am quite busy, as you can see by the design of this (responsive!!!) page. If you’d like to get in touch I suggest hitting the back-button towards Google and contacting me through my LinkedIn profile. Thanks!
