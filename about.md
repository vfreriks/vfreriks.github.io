## Hi there, I’m Victor. ##

I design and code layouts using __HTML(5)__, CSS(3), JavaScript and usually some kind of PHP framework or CMS combined with Git. However I spend quite some time coding themes for .NET projects as well.

Currently I am employed at Divtag near ’s Hertogenbosch and take on freelance projects as well.

I am quite busy, as you can see by the design of this (responsive!!!) page. If you’d like to get in touch I suggest hitting the back-button towards Google and contacting me through my LinkedIn profile. Thanks!
